## Description

enCoded is a social networking platform catered specifically to the Tech Community. Unlike linkedIn, enCoded will provide only relevant information to its tech guru users. This is a platform to connect and interact with other industry professionals, companies, schools, apply for jobs. Down the road the app will included advanced search bar functionality as well as instant messaging to easily contact the user's connections on the platform. The app utilizes the apollo client library with graphql queries/mutations to interact with the Mongo database.
